|service| |global-write-clusters| require developers to define 
single or multi-region :guilabel:`Zones`, where each zone supports
write and read operations from geographically local shards. You can also
configure zones to support global low-latency secondary reads. For more 
information on |global-write| zones, see :ref:`global-writes-zones`.

|service| does not auto-configure or auto-shard collections. 
Sharded collections must meet specific compatibility requirements to 
utilize |global-write|. For more information on guidance and 
requirements for sharding collections for |global-write|, see 
:ref:`global-writes-collections`.
